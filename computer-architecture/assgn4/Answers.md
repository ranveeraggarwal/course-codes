[Getting warmed up with the cross compiler]
A cross compiler is a compiler capable of creating executable code for a platform other than the one on which the compiler is running. It means that the host and the taeget computers are not the same.
A compiler is a program that turns source code into executable code. Like all programs, a compiler runs on a specific type of computer, and the new programs it outputs also run on a specific type of computer. The computer the compiler runs on is called the host, and the computer the new programs run on is called the target.

[Answering performance related questions]
For the non-optimised executable,
The number of cycles in Single Cycle Implementation is:  725
The number of cycles in Multi Cycle Implementation is:  603
Their ratio is:  1.20232172471
For the optimised executable,
The number of cycles in Single Cycle Implementation is:  360
The number of cycles in Multi Cycle Implementation is:  261
Their ratio is:  1.37931034483

[Conclusion]
The optimised code is much much faster than the non optimised code
Multi Cycle Implementeation is more efficient that Single Cycle Implementation
