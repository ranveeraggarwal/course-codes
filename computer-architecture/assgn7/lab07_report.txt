[Benefits of data forwarding in the MIPS64 pipeline]

[Q1]
With data forwarding enabled, number of clock cycles = 187
With data forwarding disabled, number of clock cycles = 258

[Q2]
With data forwarding disabled, number of clock cycles = 258
With data forwarding enabled, number of clock cycles = 177

[Code scheduling for performance improvement]
[Q3-4]
The number of stalls reduced to 126 and cycles to 159.
The stalls that couldn't be optimised by scheduling were those between muli and the next addi.

[Code Unrolling]
[Q5]
The number of stalls were 177, though the number of cycles reduced to 165 from 177

[Code Unrolling and Scheduling]
[Q6]
The number of stalls reduced to 78 and cycles to 123.
There are still stalls between sd and beq in the end and also an ld and an sd. But, removing them created more stalls and I chose lesser of two evils.
