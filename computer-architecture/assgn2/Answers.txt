[Part1: Learning xspim system calls for input/output]
Ans: Code in add.s

[Part2: Global data declarations, arrays]
Ans1: Overwrote add.s
Ans2: Code in array.s

[Part3: Using arrays, writing functions]
Ans: 
1. Debugging is difficult, because you can't print at all points
2. Small code becomes too large
3. Remembering register names is difficult
